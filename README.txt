BeaconSCM - Release 1.0
Conjured together by Nym.

ABOUT:
A simple command line utility which generates and writes xml service entries
based on input assemblies. No command line arguments.

INSTALL:
The only xml file that should need editing can be found in Config/Properties.config
The xml is will documented, and will ask you to enter:
* The location of the service files to update
* The location of the assemblies to read.
* Where in the service files to add the new services.

RELEASE NOTES:
Currently you can only specify an xml element location for all service files. This
essentially means they all have the same structure.

BUGS:
No known bugs.
